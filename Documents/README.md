# NUCLEO-L476RG Nucleo-64 board

## Overview

The STM32 Nucleo-64 board provides an affordable and flexible way for users to try out new concepts and build prototypes by choosing from the various combinations of performance and power consumption features, provided by the STM32 microcontroller. For the compatible boards, the internal or external SMPS significantly reduces power consumption in Run mode. The ARDUINOÂ® Uno V3 connectivity support and the ST morpho headers allow the easy expansion of the functionality of the STM32 Nucleo open development platform with a wide choice of specialized shields.

The STM32 Nucleo-64 board does not require any separate probe as it integrates the ST-LINK debugger/programmer.
